# Neural Network from Scratch

A hands-on implementation of a neural network built from the ground up, designed as a learning project to deepen understanding of both neural network fundamentals and programming language capabilities.

## Project Goals

This project serves as an educational journey to:
- **Understand Neural Networks**: Build intuition about how neural networks actually work by implementing core algorithms from scratch
- **Master Programming Languages**: Strengthen proficiency in the chosen programming languages through practical application
- **Learn by Building**: Gain deep insights that come only from implementing complex systems without relying on high-level libraries

## Current Status

**Work in Progress** - Currently developing the track builder component for the simulator using bezier curves.

### Project Structure

## Components

### Simulator
The neural network training and visualization environment.

- **track_drawer/** - Tool for creating custom track layouts
- **tracks/** - Collection of training tracks

## Technologies

_[To be added as development progresses]_

## Learning Resources

This project is inspired by the desire to understand:
- Forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent and optimization
- Activation functions
- Network architecture design
- Training and evaluation processes

## Getting Started

_[Setup instructions will be added as the project develops]_

## Development Log

- **Current**: Building track builder for simulator
- **Next**: [To be determined]

## Contributing

This is a personal learning project, but suggestions and feedback are welcome!
